# ventoy-nord-theme-custom

![demo image for 1080p uefi mode](https://github.com/giabao06/ventoy-nord-theme-custom/blob/source/assests/demo_1080_uefi.png?raw=true)

## Features
 - Basic ventoy theme
 - Suitable for treeview users (I may or may not work on custom ISO icons)
 - Multi resolution and mode support WIP (currently only has 1920x1080 UEFI)
 
## Installation
 1. Clone this repository
 2. Copy the `ventoy` folder to the root of the USB drive
  - In Windows, assuming USB drive letter A, it should sit in `A:\ventoy`
  - In Linux, assuming USB mountpoint `/media/username/Ventoy`, it should sit in `/media/username/Ventoy/ventoy`
 3. Enjoy the theme I guess
 
## Other information
 - You can find all the original .xcf files for the backgrounds, as well as all images used there in the source/xcf directory.
 - Remember to backup and copy over your ventoy config  
 
## Thanks
 - Ventoy authors and maintainers, for such an awesome tool
 - [The distro-grub-theme project](https://github.com/AdisonCavani/distro-grub-themes) because I started the theme from theirs
